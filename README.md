IMPORTANT INFORMATION (25. June 2012)
---
This project has now been **taken over by iKeirNez**, who will continue work on CommandsEX in the same fashion I did - and even better! It was a pleasure to create this tiny little thingy for you guys. Have some great Minecraft days in there and see you all in another life :) zathrus_writer

Build your very own plugin set - Lego style!
---
If you ever needed a single function but had to download a massive plugin that contained it, you will probably know the feeling. It could be hard to pick up the right plugin-set for a server with all the plugins currently in existence. Especially since many of them conflict with each other.

That is the idea behind **CommandsEX** project - to allow server administrators to choose which commands and functions they really need and let them trash all the rest.


More information

* [Official Wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/commandsex/wiki)
* [CommandsEX Builder](http://commandsex.sourceforge.net) - create your very own CommandsEX build!
* [CommandsEX Test Server](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/commandsex/pages/test-server/) - play about with the latest features not yet available to download!


Configuration
---
**CommandsEX** uses standard config.yml file, located in CommandsEX folder in your plugins directory. Options in the configuration file are clearly commented and their list is also present in the [Configuration](https://sourceforge.net/p/commandsex/wiki/Configuration) section of the [plugin Wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/commandsex/wiki).

Additionally, **CommandsEX** allows anybody with the permission to access the **/cex** command. Some options from the config file are retrievable and can also be updated via this command.
